# Conversational Chatbot

This project involves implementing a chatbot using the BlenderBot model from Hugging Face. The chatbot facilitates back-and-forth conversations with users in natural language by leveraging a pre-trained model designed for conversational tasks.

The potential of this project extends beyond merely exploring conversational AI or chatbot systems; it can also contribute to advancing natural language capabilities further.
